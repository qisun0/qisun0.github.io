<h2>
Prospective students (including the first-year PhD students)
</h2>
From now on, the high priority of the lab student recruitment will be given to students who successfully collaborated with me, received strong references from faculties in related fields, or demonstrated a strong publication record.


<h2>Your role as a PhD student</h2>
A PhD career is not just a "study" or "education": it is about professional training. That said, it is probably the most rewarding training that you do not even pay for but instead receiving a stipend.

However, that also means your behaviors and performance are not just on your own, but a lab, a department, and a school. In order to have you a successful PhD career, or at least a sustainable match to my lab, here are the policies that you need to know ahead and follow.

<h2>Research Progress</h2>
At NYU Tandon, your first year will either be covered by the school's fellowship or RA. For the former, that does NOT indicate I will be your final advisor, but rather the purpose of the first year is to do research with me (or others) with the goal of finding a permanent PhD advisor. In effect, itâ€™s a time for both you and me to decide whether we can work effectively together towards your first top venue publication. Supposedly, you already have some domain knowledge to dive immediately into interesting research projects.

By the end of the first year, you should aim to make sufficient progress on a research project that passes my threshold for submission to a top international publication venue. Whether it gets accepted is out of my control. I will also take responsibility if the idea goes to a dead-end which is very common. However, the aim is to assess your passion, persistence, work ethic, and curiosity. If you miss any of these, deciding NOT to pursue a PhD as early as possible would actually be beneficial to your longer-term career and life: you will get 10X pay and 10% workload by directly getting to the (hot) computer industry with a bachelors or masters. A successful PhD grad in my lab is expected to publish 3-5 top venue papers (SIGGRAPH/ToG/Nature(sub-journals)/Science(sub-journals)/PNAS, etc.) to form up a thesis to be eligible for the degree.

<h2>Work Ethics</h2>

Again, as a PhD student, you conduct research for your passion, your future career dream, contributing to the whole society/humanity. 
That is, you work for yourself other than passively receive education credits and get a degree (you will not if you think so). It can be one of the most rewarding careers, but it will not be enjoyable (and you will not be successful) if you are not passionate or proactive about it. This is so much EASIER to say/sell/promise to me, but you should ask your own heart.
It is also important for you to maintain your work-life balance to remain satisfied with mental/physical health. But it doesn't mean that you usually just pretend to sit in the lab yet have your brain empty thinking about your night video games/films or how to deal with next progress reporting to me.
Consider someone who considers research as their fun life 24x7 vs. someone who treats a PhD as a 9-5 job. I don't see the possibility that the latter type can succeed. 


<h2>Internships</h2>
I am fully supportive of the lab's students doing summer research internships. But that is for research internships only which contribute to your research theme, publication records, and research community connections. I do NOT support engineering internship which is for money/return offers; you will have plenty opportunities for these after your graduation.
I come from industrial research before joining academia. So, I have seen the reality in the frontline labs: due to the fierce competition in applying for top labs (e.g., NVIDIA Research, Adobe Research, FRL, etc.), researchers usually expect the intern candidate to have a strong publication record in tier 1 venues before hiring them, to ensure project success. Usually, I pick up 1 intern out of ~100 applicants. So your opportunity of getting the supported internship is also entirely dependent on how early you can publish your first top-tier paper.
